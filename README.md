# Bike_Sales_Project
This repository contains the Excel-based **Bike Sales Dashboard** that I built to analyze various dimensions of bike purchasing behavior, providing valuable insights for businesses.

## Features
- **Demographic Breakdown**: Analysis by age group, gender, and region.
- **Commute Distance**: Purchases categorized by commute distances, showing trends in short-distance commuters.
- **Occupation Analysis**: Breakdown of bike purchases by different occupational groups.
- **Interactive Filters**: Dynamic filtering options for **marital status**, **education**, and **region** to explore specific customer segments.

## Key Insights
1. **Middle-Aged customers** (ages 30-50) dominate bike purchases, particularly in **North America**.
2. **Short-distance commuters** (0-1 miles) are the most frequent buyers.
3. There is an almost equal distribution of purchases between **Male** (51%) and **Female** (49%) buyers.
4. **Professionals** and **Skilled Manual Workers** are the largest occupational groups making bike purchases.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Microsoft Excel**: Used for data analysis, creating pivot tables, and building visualizations (bar charts, pie charts, line graphs).
- **Pivot Tables & Charts**: For creating interactive reports with dynamic slicers.
- **Conditional Formatting**: To visually enhance key metrics and trends.

## How to Use
1. Download the Excel file from this repository.
2. Open the file in Excel.
3. Use the filters to explore data trends by different dimensions such as marital status, education, and region.
4. Review the various charts to understand customer preferences.

## Learning Outcomes
- Gained hands-on experience with **data visualization** using Excel.
- Enhanced ability to derive actionable insights from raw data.
- Developed skills in building **interactive dashboards** for business use cases.
 
## Future Improvements
- Integrating this data with **Power BI** for deeper analysis and online sharing.
